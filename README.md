How to Protect Yourself from Fake Emails
1. Check the Sender’s Email Address Carefully
Phishing emails often come from lookalike addresses (e.g., support@paypa1.com instead of @paypal.com)

Hover over the sender to see the full email address.

2. Never Click Suspicious Links
Hover over links (without clicking) to see the destination URL.

If it looks strange (e.g., paypal-verification123.com), don’t click.

3. Avoid Downloading Attachments from Unknown Sources
Especially if it’s a .zip, .exe, or .docm file — these could contain malware or ransomware.

4. Look for Red Flags in the Email Content
Urgent or threatening language (“Your account will be suspended”)

Poor grammar or spelling

Generic greetings (“Dear Customer” instead of your name)

5. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Even if someone steals your password, MFA adds a second layer of protection.

 6. Keep Software and Antivirus Updated
Regular updates patch vulnerabilities that attackers exploit.

Use a reputable antivirus with email scanning features.

 7. Use Email Filters
Most email services (like Gmail, Outlook, etc.) have spam/phishing filters. Keep them turned on and report phishing attempts.

 8. Never Share Sensitive Info Over Email
Legitimate companies will never ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or SSNs via email.

 9. Verify Suspicious Emails with the Real Company
Don’t reply to the email. Instead, go to the company’s official website and contact them through verified channels.

 10. Educate Yourself & Others
Learn to spot phishing attempts.

Help coworkers, family, or friends understand what to watch for.
