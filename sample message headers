 # Key Things to Analyze in the Header
Field	What to Check
Return-Path	Is it the same domain as the real company (e.g., @paypal.com)?
Received	Shows the real IP address and mail server path.
Authentication-Results	Look for spf=fail, dkim=fail, or dmarc=fail. These mean it likely wasn't authorized by the real company.
Message-ID	Fake or unusual domain often appears here.
From vs Reply-To	Sometimes the visible "From" looks safe, but "Reply-To" goes to a fraudster's address.
