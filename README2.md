#  How to Identify a Fake or Phishing Email
🧪 1. Check the Sender’s Email Address
Look closely at the domain after the “@” symbol.

✅ Legit: support@paypal.com

❌ Fake: support@paypalsecurity-alert.com or paypal@account-verify.com

⚠️ 2. Look for Urgent or Threatening Language
Common scare tactics:

“Your account will be suspended in 24 hours”

“Unusual login detected”

“Click immediately to avoid termination”

🙅‍♂️ 3. Generic Greetings
Phishing emails often say:

“Dear Customer” or “Dear User”

Legit companies typically use your real name if you're a registered user.

🔗 4. Check Links Without Clicking
Hover over the link and check the URL.

✅ Legit: https://www.paypal.com/

❌ Fake: http://paypal-account-verify.com/login.php

📎 5. Suspicious Attachments
Be careful with unexpected attachments, especially:

.exe, .zip, .scr, .docm

These can carry malware.

🧾 6. Poor Spelling or Grammar
Many fake emails are full of:

Misspellings

Odd sentence structure

Unprofessional formatting

✅ 7. Check for Authentication Results (If You Have Headers)
In the full email header, look for:

SPF: fail, DKIM: fail, DMARC: fail → 🚩 Red flags

🕵️‍♂️ 8. Unusual Requests
Asking you to:

Reset your password via a third-party site

Confirm bank or credit card info

Transfer money

🔐 Legitimate companies will never ask for passwords or sensitive info via email.
